# explorable-world

My final project for my Computer Graphics course was a 3D explorable world. Topics covered included modelling, animation, collision, texture/bump mapping and more. For a detailed overview of the project go to docs/finalreport.pdf

To build the project, type premake4 gmake -> make at the root to build the shared code.
Next, type premake4 gmake -> make in the src directory to build the project code.
